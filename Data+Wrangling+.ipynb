    "# Data wrangling document for my capstone project on heart attack prediction data set.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the preparation of the model that I will build for this project I will have to first properly prepare the data.\n",
    "I will look at the raw data that was presented to me and see in context what I actually had to work with. \n",
    "\n",
    "### I am fortunate that this dataset is well prepared and that there is minimum amount of time needed to be done in the data wrangling/cleaning process\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unnecessary Columns \n",
    "There were no unnecessary columns in the data set. Data was prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing Values  \n",
    "There are a significant amount of values missing which I will choose to impute with mean values for now but for future work I will try different approaches of model building with these missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlier - There were no significant outliers in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Imbalanced Data  \n",
    "The data was imbalanced in that there were more patients that did not suffer a heart attack than did. For the initial model I will do no resampling just to have a baseline level of performance but for additional/future work I will perform resampling techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Categorical Variables  \n",
    "Two specific columns contained categorical features that needed to be accounted for and changed in the data cleaning process (Sex and chest pain)."
